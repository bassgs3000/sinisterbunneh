This is a site made for my fiance's artwork to be showcased on.

If you are planning on copying this site, please give credit. I worked hard on
this.

Configuration
-------------
The deploy branch has the files ready for deployment, the only changes needed
are as follows:

### Ganalytics
	config/environments/production.rb
### Database
	config/database.yml
### Deployment
	config/deploy.rb
### Registration Code
	app/models/user.rb

Usage
-----
This site should be simple to use once deployed. Assuming the files above had
the default values edited.

Admins will need to sign up using the registration code. Users will not have 
logins. This way the content displayed is of the artist in question. 

Credits
----------
This site was programmed and designed by Edwin Millan-Rodriguez.
